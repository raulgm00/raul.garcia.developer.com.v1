      <description>Hardcover books have a stiff binding. Paperback books have cheaper, flexible covers which tend to be less durable. An alternative to paperback is the glossy cover, otherwise known as a dust cover, found on magazines, and comic books. Spiral-bound books are bound by spirals made of metal or plastic. Examples of spiral-bound books include teachers&amp;rsquo; manuals and puzzle books (crosswords, sudoku).&#xA;Photo by Freepik There are several other types of books which are not commonly found under this system.</description>
